# Predictive Analytics & Modelling

This repository contains **hands-on Jupyter notebook implementations** of core **predictive analytics and ensemble learning algorithms**, organized module-wise for clarity and academic submission.

The work focuses on **tree-based models, ensemble techniques, and boosting methods**, using real-world datasets for both **classification and regression** tasks.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

* Decision Trees
* Random Forests (Classification & Regression)
* AdaBoost
* Gradient Boosting
* XGBoost
* Ensemble Voting (Max Voting)
* Model evaluation using real datasets

These implementations align with **predictive modeling, ensemble learning, and applied machine learning** concepts.
